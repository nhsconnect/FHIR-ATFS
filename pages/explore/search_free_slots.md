## Use case ##

A consuming system requests slots from a provider system matching the selected date/time range and for a specific service.

## Security ##

- utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization.
- utilises a JSON Web Token (JWT) to transmit clinical Consumer system identity and authorisation details.

## Search parameters ##

Provider systems SHALL support the following search parameters that be passed to the API:

| Name | Type | Description | Paths |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | `token` | The free/busy status of the slots | `Slot.status` |
| `start` | `date` | Slot start date/time. | `Slot.start` |
| `end` | `date` | Slot end date/time. | `Slot.end` |
| `HealthcareService id` | `Id` | The id of the HealthcareService related to the Schedule/Slot | `HealthcareService.id` |

## _include parameters ##

Provider systems SHALL support the following include parameters:

| Name | Description | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| `&_include=Slot:schedule` | Include Schedule Resources referenced within the returned Slot Resources | `Slot.schedule` |
| `&_include:recurse= Schedule:actor:Practitioner` | Include Practitioner Resources referenced within the returned Schedule Resources | `Schedule.actor:Practitioner` |
| `&_include:recurse= Schedule:actor:PractitionerRole` | Include Practitioner Role Resources referenced within the returned Schedule Resources | `Schedule.actor:PractitionerRole` |
| `&_include:recurse= Schedule:actor:HealthcareService` | Include HealthcareService Resources referenced within the returned Schedule Resources | `Schedule.actor:HealthcareService` |
| `&_include:recurse= HealthcareService:providedBy` | Include Organization Resources referenced within the returned HealthcareService Resources | `HealthcareService.providedBy` |
| `&_include:recurse= HealthcareService:location` | Include Location Resources referenced within the returned HealthcareService Resources | `HealthcareService.location` |

## RESTful Query ##

The following query demonstrates a full request for information:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
http://[hostname]/Slot?status=free&start=le2018-10-29T09:49:18.705+01:00
&schedule.actor:healthcareservice=24337
&_include:recurse=Slot:schedule
&_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:HealthcareService
&_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:Practitioner
&_include:recurse=Schedule:actor:PractitionerRole
&_include:recurse=HealthcareService:location
&_include:recurse=HealthcareService:providedBy:organization
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The following parameters SHALL be included in the request:

- The `start` parameter SHALL be included once in the request.
- The `start` parameter SHALL be supplied with the `le` search prefix. For example, 'start=le2018-01-02T09:15:30:00Z', which indicates that the consumer would like slots where the slot start date/time is at or before "2018-01-02T09:15:30Z".
- Slots that have already started and end after the start parameter should be included in the response.

## Prerequisites ##

## API usage ##

#### Error handling ####

The provider system SHALL return an error if:

- the `status` parameter is absent or is present with a value other than `free`

SHALL return an `Operation Outcome` resource that provides additional detail when one or more parameters are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful retrieval of "free" slot details.
- SHALL include the free `Slot` details for the organisation which have a `status` of "free" and meet the requested date/time criteria.
 
  The response `Bundle` SHALL only contain `Schedule`, `HealthcareService`, `Organization`, `Location`, `Practitioner` and `PractitionerRole` resources related to the returned free `Slot` resources. If no free slots are returned for the requested time period then no resources should be returned within the response `Bundle`.
